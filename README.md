## Transaction Table Page Overview

### Responsive Layout Previews

The Transaction Table page is designed to be fully responsive across different screen sizes. Below are screenshots showing how the layout adapts:

### Component Structure

The page consists of the following components:

#### 1. Filter Component
- This component allows users to apply filters such as date range, category, or type.
- It updates the URL with query parameters reflecting the current filter state.
- These filters are used to control the data shown in the Transaction Table.

#### 2. Transaction Table Component
- This component reads the current filter values from the URL.
- Based on those filters, it updates and renders the transaction data.
- Each change in the filter results in a new view of the data being shown.

#### 3. Transaction Service
- This component handles data fetching.
- It receives the current filter values and fetches corresponding transactions.
- It abstracts the data retrieval logic and serves as the interface between the frontend and the backend or mock data source.

### Flow Summary

1. The user applies filters through the Filter component.
2. The URL is updated with the current filter state.
3. The Transaction Table reads the URL and requests data accordingly.
4. The Transaction Service fetches the filtered data.
5. The table updates with the new transaction records.
