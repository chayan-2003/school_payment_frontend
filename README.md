## Transaction Table Page Overview

### Responsive Layout Previews

The Transaction Table page is designed to be fully responsive across different screen sizes. Below are screenshots showing how the layout adapts:

| Orientation | Screenshot |
|-------------|------------|
| Desktop View (Light) | ![](https://i.ibb.co/8LLXqZ44/Transaction-Table-Light-Desktop-png.png) |
| Desktop View (Dark) | ![](https://i.ibb.co/4Zj4CZsg/Transaction-Table-Dark-Desktop-png.png)|
| Mobile View (Light) | ![](https://i.ibb.co/ZzLctsML/Transaction-Light-Mode-Mobile-png.png) |

### Component Structure

The page consists of the following components:

#### 1. Filter Component
- This component allows users to apply filters such as date range, category, or type.
- It updates the URL with query parameters reflecting the current filter state.
- These filters are used to control the data shown in the Transaction Table.

#### 2. Transaction Table Component
- This component reads the current filter values from the URL.
- Based on those filters, it updates and renders the transaction data.
- Each change in the filter results in a new view of the data being shown.

#### 3. Transaction Service
- This component handles data fetching.
- It receives the current filter values and fetches corresponding transactions.
- It abstracts the data retrieval logic and serves as the interface between the frontend and the backend or mock data source.

### Flow Summary

1. The user applies filters through the Filter component.
2. The URL is updated with the current filter state.
3. The Transaction Table reads the URL and requests data accordingly.
4. The Transaction Service fetches the filtered data.
5. The table updates with the new transaction records.
6. Got it! Here's a refined summary for your GitHub README, starting with the responsive layout and summarizing the core functionality:

---

### Flow Summary

1. **User Input**:
   - The user fills in the required fields: School ID, Amount, and Callback URL.

2. **Payment Submission**:
   - Upon clicking the **"Pay Now"** button, the form data is sent to the backend API (`/create-payment`).
   - The API generates a payment request and returns a `collect_request_url`.

3. **Redirection**:
   - The user is redirected to the `collect_request_url` to complete the payment process.

4. **Error Handling**:
   - If the payment request fails, an error message is displayed using the `toast` notification system.

---

### **Key Considerations**

1. **Multiple Transactions for a Single Order**:  
   - Transactions are an aggregation of `Order` and `OrderStatus`.  
   - Due to this relationship, there may be multiple `OrderStatus` entries for the same `Order`, resulting in multiple transactions associated with a single `customOrderId`.  

2. **Custom Order ID Format**:  
   - The `customOrderId` is designed for ease of understanding and follows a sequential format, such as `ORD-1001`, `ORD-1002`, etc.  
   - This field provides a user-friendly way to identify orders.  

3. **Service Layer Functions**:  
   - The service layer includes critical API logic to handle core functionalities.  
   - It also contains functions to support analytics, ensuring the system can provide insights into transaction data.  

4. **Dummy Data in Analytics**:  
   - The "Recent Transactions" table in the analytics dashboard may display data ahead of the current time due to the use of dummy data.  
   - However, the line graph showing transactions for the last year is designed to display data only up to the present date.  

5. **Frontend Loading Time**:  
   - If the loading time is slightly higher, it could be due to server-side render inactivity or delays in fetching data from the backend.  
   - Optimizations can be applied to improve responsiveness if necessary.
